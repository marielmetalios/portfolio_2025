# Portfolio

## About

This is a starter project for my future portfolio. It is a front-end site built with Vite / Javascript, React, and Tailwind. Please note **all** content here is "placeholder" information, including my "About Me" and the resume download. This site purpose is to test functionality, and the contact form stores information to local storage only. 

## Usage

This is for personal use, mainly coding practice/education purposes, but can be replicated as a baseline for other projects.
